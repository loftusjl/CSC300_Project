	appears:[`A gelatinous green slime pulsates from under a nearby bush. It leaves a glistening trail as it moves to block your path.`],
	attacked:[`You twist, whirl you, and flash your sword at the slime. It appears unimpressed. However, it also doesn't move as you plunge your sword to the hilt into its undulating mass. The center seems thicker and more vital. The slime shudders as you withdraw your blade and step back.`],
	attacking:[`As you hack at the mass, the "fluids"? Congeal into small tendrils that seem to spider into your arm. A shudder goes down your spine as you glimpse a taste of your fate should you fall here.`],
	defeated:[`You strike mightily at what seems to be the core of the abomination. The slime shrinks in on itself before losing all consistency and splashing to the ground in a sickening puddle.`],
	defended:[`The slime forms spidering tendrils which grasp your leg and swiftly move up your body. You slack in desperation as you quickly become enveloped. The only thing left to mark your failure is a greasy stain on the ground. A grim warning to any future adventurers.`],
